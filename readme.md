# Password Generator WebApp

Website Story

  I implimented html form elements and javascript code that concatinates strings of the user chosen password criteria. The user can choose to generate a secure password from 8 to 128 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. 

Use Instructions:

    Interact with the form elements and click generate password and the page will display the password in the text box. Feel free to display more than one password one after another.

Challenges & Future Implementation Goals:

    For this project I had to become familiar with the Math.floor & Math.random methods in order to build the password generation loop. initially I struggled to think of a way to validate that the user had selected at least one checkbox but I come up with a one line solution of just checking if the password variable was still initialized as "".
